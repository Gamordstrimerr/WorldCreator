# WorldCreator

#### Description: 
```
This repository contains the source code for a Minecraft plugin called WorldCreator.  
WorldCreator is a plugin designed to allow players to create and delete worlds using commands.
```

## Features:


- #### Automatic Save & Load :
Each world created by the player is saved in a `YAMLConfiguration` file and loaded at the server startup.


- #### World Creation :
Worlds are created using the `WorldCreator` class from the Spigot API.


- #### World Deletion :
When a player deletes a world, all players logged into it are first teleported to the spawn.
Then, the world is unloaded and deleted. Once this process is executed, the worldâ€™s directory is erased using the Apache Commons IO Library.


## Commands:
Players can execute `/help WorldCreator` in-game to get a list of available plugin commands.


```
- /create-world <name> : command to create a world.
- /delete-world <name> : command to delete a world.
- /get-world : command to get the world where the player is.
- /list-world : command to get a list of the worlds of the server
- /spawn : command to teleport to the spawn
- /teleport-world <list | name> :
  -> <name> : teleport the player to the world specified
  -> <list> : allow the player to get a list of the different worlds (same as the /list-world command)
```


## Permissions:
Permissions for each command (can be set using plugins like [Luckperms](https://luckperms.net/)).


```
- /create-world -> worldcreator.create-world
- /delete-world -> worldcreator.delete-world
- /get-world -> worldcreator.get-world
- /list-world -> worldcreator.list-world
- /spawn -> worldcreator.spawn
- /teleport-world -> worldcreator.teleport-world
```


## Aliases:
Each command has aliases (short versions of the command).


```
- /create-world <name> : /cw <name>
- /delete-world <name> : /dw <name>
- /get-world : /gw
- /list-world : /lw
- /spawn : /hub | /lobby
